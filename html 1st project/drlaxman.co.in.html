    <p>From a small village to one of the best research organizations and one of the largest pharmaceutical companies…….the journey of Laxman…..</p>
    <p>Dr. Laxman Pasunoori (fondly called Laxmana by his parents and family members, Laxman by senior friends and Laxman anna by juniors and Lachchi dada by few close friends), was born on 1st October 1975 (as one of the twins) in a middle-class family to Pasunoori Vitobha and Sushila of Zaffergadh village, Jangaon District of Telangana (erstwhile Andhra Pradesh).</p>
    <p>He completed his early education in Zaffergadh and 10th grade in Adarsha School, Hanamkonda, Intermediate Education and B.Sc. (specialization in Chemistry, Zoology and Fisheries) from CKM College Warangal. Later he joined Osmania University (University College of Science) and completed his M.Sc. Organic Chemistry in 1999.He was an excellent student from his childhood. He won several awards like best student-teacher award (on teacher’s day) during the school days. He was top ranker in the entrance exams conducted for post-graduate admissions by various universities such as Kakatiya University, Osmania University, University of Hyderabad and Pune University. He qualified for a prestigious UGC-CSIR (NET) fellowship during the 2nd year of his post-graduation that indicates his academic excellence.</p>
    <p>He joined Dr. T. K. Chakraborty’s group in October 1999 for his Ph.D. and contributed for the stereoselective total synthesis of the natural products Crocacin-A, Crocacin-C, Crocacin-D. He was involved in the total synthesis of Stevastelin – B3, worked towards the synthesis of the C15-C21 fragment of (-) – Discodermolide and multi gram synthesis of Naltrexone. He developed a novel route to synthesize 6-amino-2, 5-anhydro-6-deoxy-D-Gluconic acid from Glutamic acid unstable vinyl amines. In 2004, he joined The Scripps Research Institute, San Diego, USA as Skaggs Postdoctoral Fellow with Dr. K.C. Nicolaou (one of the pioneering scientists in organic synthesis), worked for two years on the total synthesis of biologically active natural product Uncialamycin, a powerful anticancer agent, and published in reputed journals (Angew Chem Int Eng and J. Am. Chem. Soci.).</p>
    <p>He then relocated back to India in 2006 and started his career with Expicor Pharma Private Ltd., (Hetero Drugs), Hyderabad, followed by Sai Life Sciences Ltd., Hyderabad, as a Principal Scientist (2008 – 2010). In October 2010 he joined Biocon Bristol Myers Squibb Research Centre (BBRC), Bengaluru and was associated with the same organization till recent times as a Senior Principal Investigator. At BBRC, he made significant contributions in multiple therapeutic areas (Immunology, Metabolic Disorders, Cardiovascular, and CNS) in the medicinal chemistry division. His contributions as a co-inventor/co-author led to 12 patents (and counting), 9 peer-reviewed publications (including ACS Med Chem Lett) and 3 preclinical candidates including a drug candidate in Phase II clinical trials. Along with these, he successfully solved many complex problems with his insights in chemistry. </p>
    <p>On a personal front, he was known for his helping nature. There are hundreds of people made their career with the help of Laxman. He never indulged in any kind of arguments and he had no enemy (in Telegu అజాతశత్రువు). He was energetic all the time and friendly with everyone. In the friends’ circle and family, he made his presence with his smile, calmness and was well known for his trouble shooting capabilities. He was down to earth and affable. He was steadfast at work and pleasant off-work despite enduring major personal losses and setbacks in his early adulthood and middle age. He never missed a chance to celebrate Dussehra and Sankranti with his family in Zaffergadh, sip a cup of chai (tea) and watch an Indian movie.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, Dr Laxman Pasunoori passed away on 18th January 2023 after fighting with a rare cancer for almost a year. The kid, who dedicated his life to medicine discovery and contributed to research in Cancer, Immunology, Metabolic Disorders, Cardiovascular and CNS, could not find the perfect medicine to go on with his mission to save others lives. He is survived by wife (Geethika), a daughter (Bhavishya; 10 years), a son (Vishrudh; 7 years), parents and five siblings.</p>
    <p> <strong> In summary, his family will miss the dearest member, his friends the best buddy and the World a medicine or two.</strong></p>
